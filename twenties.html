                        <img src="https://www.isro.gov.in/media_isro/image/index/Chandrayaan3/R_img4.png.webp">
                        <p class="twenties-mission-desc">The Chandrayaan program is an actively ongoing program. Chandrayaan-3 was launched in 2023 and is still performing its mission. It consists of 3 components: a propulsion module to bring the craft over to the Moon, a lander module, and a lunar rover inside the lander module. The picture above was taken by the rover, and it's called Pragyan. It's possible that there's still more Chandrayaan missions to come.</p>

                        <p class="twenties-mission-desc">The Chang'e Program seems to have really taken off. In 2020 Chang'e 5 launched, accomplishing China/CNSA's first successful lunar sample mission. Chang'e 6 launched last year, also a successful sample mission like 5, although this one went to the lunar far side, and is the first spacecraft to return samples from the far side. It's expected there will be a Chang'e 7, 8, and 9 in the future.</p>

                        <p class="twenties-mission-desc">This is the first time I'm mentioning South Korea. The Korean space agency, called KARI, has launched their first lunar orbiter, Danuri, in 2022. They say on their own website that they do not want to be far behind everyone else in this new era of space exploration & development. So that's cool. And Danuri is expected to perform its lunar studies and such until 2027.</p>

                        <p class="twenties-mission-desc">This is a cool and unique mission being done by NASA. It's already been launched, about a year ago in 2024, and is expected to arrive at Jupiter's moon Europa in 2030. So mark that on your calendar. Its primary goals are similar to a lot of previous Mars missions: to do reconnaissance and search for evidence that the moon was historically capable of supporting life.</p>

                        <p class="twenties-mission-desc">This is one of the projects that I actually did know about before doing this project. I didn't watch its launch live, but I did tune in to the livestreaming of the first pictures released to the public, which was awesome. The James Webb telescope is like Hubble, in that it searches stars, galaxies, and has even been directed at some of our own planets. It's worth noting though that unlike Hubble, images from James Webb are <i>not</i> what they'd actually look like to us, since they're in infrared. But they <i>are</i> very pretty. And I've used a couple of JWST images as backgrounds for this particular page.</p>

                        <p class="twenties-mission-desc">This is another project that I knew about before doing this self-led study. I watched the livestream of Perserverance's first photos, and that was really fun. Mars 2020 consists of the newest Mars rover, Perseverance, and its buddy Ingenuity, the first Mars helicopter. Both landed on Mars in 2021. Ingenuity was a successful tech demo, completing more than 70 flights in its lifetime, and ended in 2024. Perseverance is still ongoing, driving around, collecting samples, doing science, and taking pictures.</p>

                        <p class="twenties-mission-desc">The only acronym so far: Smart Lander for Investigating Moon. It's a lunar lander developed by JAXA, and landed on the Moon in 2023. The goal seems to mainly be improving landing technology, and to inform the design of future lunar landers.</p>

                        <p class="twenties-mission-desc">A new type of mission by China, Tianwen-1 is CNSA's first successful Mars mission, arriving to the planet in 2021. And, Tianwen-1 delivered the first Chinese Mars rover, dubbed Zhurong. Zhurong completed its mission, and survived for nearly a year, though it was put in hibernation and has been unable to wake up. There is also a Tianwen-2 mission, though this one shifts gears and is focused on an asteroid sample return mission, which if successful, would be first for CNSA. It launched earlier this year. There is also the planned Tianwen-3, which is a Mars sample return mission, expected to launch in 2028. This would be a major accomplishment, if successful.</p>

                            <h3 class="twenties-upcoming-header twenties-upcoming-h3">Artemis</h3>
                            <p>This is not a robotic mission, but it is very important. The Artemis Program is a new manned space program, supported by various countries, and mainly led by NASA. Its focus is "Moon to Mars", in which a lunar exploration program is started up again, in order to better prepare for eventual manned Mars missions. Artemis-1 has already launched- an unmanned test ride of the Space Launch Vehicle and the Orion human-carrying spacecraft. Artemis-2 has been delayed quite a bit, but as of writing this, it's expected to launch next year. Artemis-2 is the same as Artemis-1, except it will be manned with 4 astronauts, who have already been selected. Artemis-3 is planned after that, and that one's really exciting because it will be the first manned lunar landing since Apollo 17. There are missions planned beyond that, but with budget cuts and concerns to NASA, it's uncertain if they'll actually be able to happen :(. But overall, Artemis is perhaps the biggest project of the decade out of all of these, and it's very much worth paying attention to.</p>

It's also nicknamed the Lunar Cruiser. What's unique about this is that it's designed for astronauts to ride inside without needing their EVA suits.</p>

It's a totally unique first-of-its-kind helicopter/drone looking craft that is going to be sent to Titan, a moon of Saturn. It's expected to launch in the later part of this decade, and will take several years to reach the moon.</p>
