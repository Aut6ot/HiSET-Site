                    <p>In the 1950s, space exploration was just getting started. In this decade we will cover the three key projects: Sputnik, Luna, and Explorer.</p>
                    <p>This will be the shortest webpage of all the decades, so enjoy the brevity while it lasts.</p>

                    <h2 class="fifties">BACKGROUND</h2>
                    <p>Before diving in, there are a couple of things you should know about: The IGY and NASA.</p>
                    <p>The International Geophysical Year, or IGY, is defined as “a global effort for a comprehensive study of the Earth, its poles, its atmosphere, and its interactions with the Sun.” This challenge encouraged rapid innovation and engineering, as well as brought about the beginning of the Space Race between the US & USSR.</p>
                    <p>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration, better known as NASA, was established in 1958. It was made up as a combination of several agencies, the largest being NACA, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics. </p>

                    <p>The Sputnik program was the USSR’s series of artificial Earth satellites.</p>
                    <p><i>Sputnik-1</i> was the world’s first artificial satellite.</p>
                    <p><i>Sputnik-2</i> put the first animal in orbit, the cosmonaut dog Laika. Though she did not survive the flight (and wasn’t intended to), her death inspired Soviets to ensure future animal-in-space missions were designed to be survivable.</p>

                    <p>The Luna program was the USSR’s series of lunar spacecraft. The program achieved a lot of impressive firsts in this decade:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><i>Luna-1</i> accomplished the first Lunar flyby</li>
                        <li><i>Luna-2</i> accomplished the first Lunar impact.</li>
                        <li><i>Luna-3</i> accomplished the first photographs of the Lunar far side.</li>

                    <h2 class="fifties">EXPLORER | ЭКСПЛОРЕР</h2>
                    <img class="fifties-img" src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/6d1f09b130c5dd87b5b9625c63f138f8/ab0f1778aeda1c34-4c/s500x750/77becdf00d977fa7b49129e29a1d49f7c9848c21.pnj">
                    <p><i>"It's Up"</i></p>
                    <p>The Explorer series was brought about when Sputnik-1 launched, which worried the US that their competing satellite they were building, the Naval Research Lab’s Vanguard, did not measure up. So the US provided funding to JPL to begin developing another satellite: Explorer. One year later and Explorer-1 launched, becoming the first US artificial satellite. Explorer-1 also first discovered Earth’s Van Allen belts.</p>
                    <p>Also, a fun fact I learned while on my JPL tour: while it was in orbit it destablized and was spinning, top to bottom. So that paints an interesting picture. They're very formal about how they word it, so if you're interested in looking into it more, you have to search something like 'spin-axis instability'.</p>
                    <h2 class="fifties">Notable Mention: Pioneer</h2>
                    <p>The Pioneer program started up during this time, though in this decade all of the intended deep-space crafts (Pioneer 0-4) were unsuccessful. Additionally, Pioneer 1 was the first spacecraft launched by NASA.</p>

                    <h2 class="fifties">SUMMARY</h2>
                    <p> In this decade, the successes of Sputnik, Luna, and Explorer showed the world saw that space exploration was possible.</p>
                    <p> Up next is the 1960s, and in this decade, we will see an absolute explosion (or supernova, if you will) of technological advancement.</p>
