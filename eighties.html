                                <p>Galileo was an orbiter-type spacecraft sent to Jupiter at the very tail-end of the decade in 1989. It wouldn't actually arrive at the planet until the middle of the next decade. Galileo far outlasted its original mission, studying Jupiter and its moons, and continued to operate until 2003 where it was driven to fall into Jupiter.</p>
                                <p>I got to see a full-scale model of this at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)'s museum, and this thing is/was huge. Truly. And I learned that the umbrella-looking thing at the top (in the picture, it's to the left)- a high-gain antenna- did not properly extend all the way, and yet scientists and engineers were able to work around it and still communicate using the low-gain antennas.</p>

                                <p>Magellan was a spacecraft that was sent to study Venus and notably mapped out the entire surface. This was done using radar, since Venus is covered in clouds.</p>
                                <p>Its major achievements include that it was the first deep-space craft to be deployed by a Space Shuttle, and it was the first spacecraft to fully map out Venus.</p>
                                <p>A lot of the computer-generated images of Venus's surface that you can find come from this craft. Pretty neat!</p>

                                <p>The project VeGa was named for its two targets, <b>Ve</b>nus & <b>Ha</b>lley's Comet (named Gallei in Russian). The project consisted of two main identical spacecraft: Vega 1 and Vega 2. Both had probes and landers they were carrying that they basically just dropped off at Venus, then set course for Halley's Comet. At the comet, they both took measurements of the dust.</p>
                                <p>I did get to see a model one of the Vegas earlier this year, though I didn't really understand the significance of it at the time. It's pretty cool, pretty big and funky-looking, and is at the Udvar-Hazy Smithsonian Air & Space museum in Virginia. Although it's not the real thing, as both will forever be in a heliocentric orbit.</p>
