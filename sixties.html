                            <p>The entire decade of the 1960s was a time of intense competition and innovation between the US and USSR. Within the 10 years, achievements went from having the first man in space (Vostok 1) to the first men walking on the moon (Apollo 11).</p>
                            <p>Also, I felt it was important to go in more detail of the manned missions here, but in later decades I will focus more on just the robotic missions.</p>
                            <p>ALSO, when describing space explorers, "Astronaut" is used for American explorers, and "Cosmonaut" is used for Soviet/Russian explorers.</p>

                                <p>Mariner was a program focused on exploring our planetary neighbors Venus and Mars. Mariners 1, 2, and 5 were set for Venus while Mariners 3, 4, 6, and 7 were Mars-bound.</p>
                                <p>Most notably: </p>
                                <p>Mariner 4 sent back the first close-up views of Mars. It's also the mission where JPL scientists drew the image of the surface themselves with pastels using the data from the spacecraft, since the image processing of the time took a while. I did get to see this framed at JPL, and it's very cool.</p>
                                <p>Mariners 6 & 7 were twin spacecraft, and were able to take more pictures of the surface of Mars. Mariner 7 in particular was hit with something, suspected to be a micrometeroid, but was still able to complete its mission.</p>

                                <p>With the success of OAO-2, aka "Stargazer", NASA had its very first astronomical observatory in space. This would pave the way for the bigger and better observatories that would come along later.</p>

                                <p>Pioneer 5 was the first to carry Telebit, the 1st digital telemetry system to be used in a US deep-space mission. The craft was intended for Venus, but plans changed and it focused on being a tech demo as well as mapping the interplanetary magnetic field.</p>
                                <p>Pioneers 6-9 were all successful, and carried out studies of interplanetary space.</p>

                                <p>Ranger was developed in support of the Apollo program. There were 9 Ranger missions, started and concluded within the decade. They focused on orbiting the Moon and studying its surface features, for potential landing spots for Apollo.</p>
                                <p>The Ranger program experienced a string of failures, and did not see a successful mission until Ranger 7. However, with Ranger 7, they accomplished the first US close-up pictures of the Moon. Rangers 8 and 9 were also successful.</p>

                                <p>There were 7 of them, and of those, only Surveyors 2 and 4 did not succeed.</p>
                                <p>Later on, Surveyor 3 was visited by the Apollo 12 astronauts, about 2 years after it completed its mission. This is featured in the image above. The astronauts were able to bring back some parts of the spacecraft, allowing scientists to study the effects of exposure on the lunar surface.</p>

                                <p>The two greatest accomplishments of the first Soviet manned space program include:</p>
                                <p>Vostok-1 put the first man in space (Yuri Gagarin).</p>
                                <p>Vostok-6, the last mission of the series, put the first woman in space (Valentina Tereshkova).</p>
                                <p>Perhaps lesser known was that Yuri Gagarin died 7 years later, when the jet plane he was piloting crashed. Valentina Tereshkova is still alive today.</p>
                                <p>Also, "Vostok" translates to mean "East". And each Vostok mission was a 1-cosmonaut mission.</p>

                                <p>I have not been able to find a source that explains a reason for the name. But. The Mercury Program was America's first manned space program, competing with the Vostok program. Like the Vostok program, they were solo Astronaut missions. There were 6 manned Mercury missions, and even before them, there were a few monkeys trained to be test pilots and go on rocket flights. My personal favorite is Ham :) and I've included him in the collage.</p>
                                <p>Of the Mercury 7, which is what the 7 astronauts were collectively called, only 1 would not fly, due to a detected issue with his heart. He would go on to fly in a later Space Shuttle mission.</p>

                                <p>The Voskhod program, which translates to "Ascent/Dawn" in English, had 2 missions.</p>
                                <p>Voskhod-1 had 3 cosmonauts, and was the 1st crewed flight for the USSR (simply meaning more than 1 person).</p>
                                <p>Voskhod-2 is kinda wack. And I love it for that. There were 2 cosmonauts, Pavel Belyayev and Aleksei Leonov. Once in orbit, Leonov became the first person to go on a spacewalk. The image above is an artistic depiction of it. But what's wack is when they returned to Earth, their automatic landing system did not kick in, and the cosmonauts had to step in and manually pilot their spacecraft, making them overshoot their landing. They landed in a frozen forest, and were stranded for 3 days and 2 nights. They were found 4 hours after they landed, but the forest was too dense for a helicopter to land. But they did deliver supplies like food and clothes to keep them comfortable, and they were equipped with a gun and ammo (for bears and wolves). From a major historical first in space to survival mission at the end, Voskhod-2 really does have it all.</p>

                                <p>I have not seen a source citing a direct reason for the Gemini program. However. Gemini is the name of a constellation that respresents a set of twins, and it also means "twins" in Greek. So I assume that's why it was named that, because each Gemini mission consisted of astronaut duos.</p>
                                <p>There were 10 manned Gemini missions, from Gemini 3 to Gemini 12. Of those:</p>
                                <p>Gemini-4 accomplished the first US spacewalk with Astronaut Ed White, a few months after the Soviet one with Voskhod-2.</p>
                                <p>Gemini-6A and 7 accomplished a rendezvous in orbit.</p>
                                <p>Gemini-9A had its original astronauts die in a jet plane crash (not in space), so the mission was carried out by their backups.</p>
                                <p>Also, just noting here, that all these missions took place within 2 years, from '65 to '66. Insane.</p>

                                <p>Soyuz, meaning "Union" in Russian, had missions 1-8 during this decade.</p>
                                <p>Soyuz-1 ended in tragedy when the solo cosmonaut Vladimir Komarov was returning to Earth, and his parachute did not deploy, killing him in the landing.</p>
                                <p>Soyuz 2 and 3 were partial failures.</p>
                                <p>Soyuz 4 & 5 were a success. They docked with each other in orbit and swapped cosmonauts. I don't know why but this is so funny to me.</p>
                                <p>Soyuz 6, 7, and 8 were a partial success. It's kinda wack though. It was planned for all 3 spacecraft to go into orbit together, with 2 docking, and the third flying with them in formation. But it was not successful.</p>

                                <p>The most famous and accomplished manned space program in history: The Apollo Program.</p>
                                <p>America announced its intentions to land a man on the Moon before the decade was out, and Apollo strove to deliver. Each manned mission consisted of 3 astronauts, building up from Gemini's duos.</p>
                                <p>Within the decade, Apollos 1 to 12 occured.</p>
                                <p>Apollo 1, similarly to the Soviet Soyuz-1, ended in tragedy. A fire caught during a pre-flight test, killing all 3 astronauts. This major blow would discourage manned flights, leading to Apollos 2-6 all being unmanned test flights. </p>
                                <p>Apollo 7 was a manned mission in Earth orbit.</p>
                                <p>Apollo 8 was the first manned flyby of the Moon.</p>
                                <p>Apollo 10 ran through everything that would be needed for a lunar landing, sans the landing itself.</p>
                                <p>And Apollo 11 was the historic landing of 2 astronauts on the moon. The third astronaut, Michael Collins, stayed behind on the Apollo Command Module, while Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin used the Apollo Lunar Module to land on and liftoff from the lunar surface.</p>
                                <p>Apollo 12 was similar to Apollo 11 in science & exploration, and one unique thing is that they were able to rendezvous with the Surveyor-3 spacecraft and return some samples of it to Earth.</p>

                                <p>The Luna mission series continued in this decade. Lunas 4-15 were the second generation of Luna. Of these, 4 through 8 were all unsuccessful.</p>
                                <p>Luna 9 was a complete success though, and accomplished the first soft landing on the moon as well as the first picture sent from the lunar surface. Luna 10 was also a major success, and was the first successful lunar orbiter. </p>
                                <p>All Lunas beyond this for the decade were successful, with the exception of Luna 15 being only partially successful.</p>

                                <p>The Mars program began this decade, though the only one launched, Mars-1, was unsuccessful. It was developed in competition with the Mars-focused Mariners.</p>

                                <p>The Venera program began this decade, consisting of Veneras 1-6. The name of the series "Venera" is simply Russian for "Venus". This program competed with the Venus-focused Mariner spacecraft.</p>
                                <p>Of these, the first two were unsuccessful.</p>
                                <p>Venera 3 did not achieve its intended soft landing (it crashed), but did become the first spacecraft to impact any planet. Venera 4 had a successful, slower descent to the surface. Veneras 5 & 6 were identical, and took in-situ measurements of things like temperature, pressure, and composition as they descended.</p>
                                <p>The USSR seemed to specialize and have more success with Venus exploration than the US. However, on the flip side, the US accomplished more successful missions with Mars.</p>

                                <p>The Zond program was a general interplanetary series of spacecraft targeted at the Moon, Venus, and Mars.</p>
                                <p>Zond 1 was an attempted Venus fly-by, but failed.</p>
                                <p>Zonds 2 & 3 were Mars-bound, but were both unsuccessful.</p>
                                <p>Zonds 5 & 6 focused on the Moon, with Zond 5 carrying the first animals that flew past the Moon. Zond 6 was successful up until its return to Earth, where a leak in the capsule killed all the small animal passengers. :(</p>
                                <p>Zond 7 was another Lunar fly-by, and it was successful.</p>
