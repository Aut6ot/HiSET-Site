                    <p>What lies ahead for space exploration?</p>
                    <h3 class="future">Manned Space Programs</h3>
                    <div style="padding: 2vh 10vw;">
                        <p>These programs seem to be starting up all across the board.</p>
                        <p>There's Artemis, which primarly involves NASA, CSA (Canada), ESA, JAXA, and the Mohammed Bin Rashid Space Center, as well as a whole host of commercial companies involved through contracts.</p>
                        <p>The CNSA has their own space station they've constructed a few years ago (Tiangong), and seem to be advancing their manned space program, known as CMS for China Manned Space.</p>
                        <p>ISRO is currently developing their manned space program, called Gaganyaan.</p>
                        <p>Generally, there seems to be a big push to land humans on Mars. This is tricky though; According to <a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20200000973/downloads/20200000973.pdf" target="_blank">this estimate</a>, it could cost about half a trillion dollars!</p>
                    </div>
                    <h3 class="future">Robotic Missions</h3>
                    <div style="padding: 2vh 10vw;">
                        <p style="font-style: italic;">I've listed below a few robotic missions that are expected to launch 2030 and beyond. However, a lot can happen, and it's quite possible many of these get delayed or even just never happen.</p>
                        <p>VERITAS and DAVINCI (I'll spare you their full names) are two separate missions, but both are geared towards exploring Venus, which has kinda been neglected since the '90s.</p>
                        <p>A NASA mission to Uranus (Uranus Orbiter and Probe) was proposed a few years ago. But plenty of missions get proposed and not executed. But I would love to see it happen.</p>
                        <p>And generally, there will probably be continuations of projects like Gaganyaan, Chang'e, and Tianwen.</p>
