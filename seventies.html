                        <p>In this decade, robotic exploration looks out and into the depths of our solar system. Launching spacecraft in pairs become trendy. Also, the European Space Agency (aka ESA) is formed in 1975.</p>
                        <p>We will start with a brief on the manned missions situation, then dive into the robotic missions.</p>

                                <p>APOLLO</p>
                                <p>Apollo continued on from the 60s, starting with the rescue mission Apollo 13 and ending with the last lunar landing mission Apollo 17. There were supposed to be Apollo missions 18-20, but they were cut due to budget contraints after the hype of the lunar landing died down. Aside from Apollo 13, the missions had astronauts explore various areas of the lunar surface, bring back samples, and a few even had the moon car to get around- the Lunar Roving Vehicle, or LRV.</p>
                                <p>SOYUZ</p>
                                <p>Like Apollo, Soyuz continued on from the 60s. This decade saw Soyuz 9 to Soyuz 34 launch, with a main focus of docking with and visiting the various Salyut space stations that also launched during the decade. It's worth noting that the Salyut program was the first manned space station program, and Salyut-1 was the very first crewed space station.</p>
                                <p>APOLLO-SOYUZ</p>
                                <p>The Apollo-Soyuz Test Project was the first international partnership in space. In 1975, working together, an Apollo command & service module manned with 3 NASA astronauts docked with a Soyuz spacecraft with 2 cosmonauts. This historic mission set the groundwork for future international collaboration.</p>
                                <p>SKYLAB</p>
                                <p>Skylab was America's first space station. There were 3 crewed missions to Skylab, ending with Skylab 4. It was around from 1973 to 1979. Though short-lived, it was a big step forward towards our modern International Space Station.</p>

                                <p>Explorer 49 is notable due to it being the last American lunar mission for two decades (lunar exploration is practically nonexistent in the 80s). Also this thing is comically huge- it’s about 1,500 feet wide, antenna tip to tip.</p>

                                <p>Luna 16 was the first successful robotic sample return from beyond Earth.</p>
                                <p>Luna 17 delivered Lunokhod-1 to the Moon, which was the first rover to explore a celestial body.</p>
                                <p>There would be another Lunokhod delivered with Luna 21. It was the longest-lived lunar rover, and drove 24 miles.</p>

                                <p>Mariners 9 and 10 launched in the 70s, with 10 being the last Mariner.</p>
                                <p>Mariner 9 was a Martian orbiter, competed with the Soviet Mars 2, and won the race to be the first to orbit Mars. Upon arriving it carried out its mission, returning thousands of images and having mapped 85% of the Martian surface.</p>
                                <p>Mariner 10 was the very first spacecraft sent to Mercury, where it did a fly-by of the planet. It also flew by Venus on its way, using it for a gravity assist.</p>

                                <p>In the 70s, the Pioneer mission came to its end with Pioneers 10 and 11. But it ended with a bang.</p>
                                <p>Pioneer 10 was the first NASA mission to go to the outer planets. It accomplished a Jupiter fly-by and well exceeded its expected lifespan, lasting for 30 years and only coming to an end in 2003. It made a lot of first, and I'm not going to list them all here. But it's very impressive and cool.</p>
                                <p>Pioneer 11 improved upon Pioneer 10 even further. It did a fly-by of Jupter and Saturn. Like its predecessor, Pioneer 11 achieved a lot of firsts, this time with its fly-by of Saturn. The last contact with it was made in 1995.</p>
                                <p>Even though both spacecraft have ceased communications and operations, they are still currently travelling out beyond the solar system.</p>

                                <p>Venera 7 was the first successful soft landing on another planet, and it was also the first spacecraft to transmit data from the surface of Venus.</p>
                                <p>Venera 9 returned the very first pictures of the surface of Venus.</p>
                                <p>Each Venera lander going on lasted longer and longer, before inevitably succumbing to the infernal heat of the Venusian surface.</p>
                                <p>What surprises me about Venus exploration is that there still haven't been pictures of the surface since Venera. There's been mapping of the planet through the Magellan probe (which will come up later on), but even those images are computer-generated based on radar data.</p>

                                <p>Perhaps the most epic and cool mission of all time. Voyager.</p>
                                <p>There were 2 spacecraft launched in 1977: twins, Voyager 1 & 2.</p>
                                <p>Voyager 1 went to Saturn and Jupiter.</p>
                                <p>Voyager 2 took advantage of a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity: all 4 outer planets were aligned in such a way it would be possible to visit all of them in one go. And so Voyager 2 did.</p>
                                <p>Voyager 2 hit Jupiter in 1979, Saturn in 1981, Uranus in 1986, and Neptune in 1989. And in 2018, it left the Heliosphere, meaning it has left the solar system. And it is still sending back data today, still travelling. </p>
                                <p>Additionally, Voyager 1 left the Heliosphere in 2012 (because it was travelling faster), and continues to hold the record of longest distance travelled by a spacecraft.</p>
